# Magic The Gathering Arena Deck Master
An application that can assist in managing decks for Magic The Gathering Arena and help build them.

A work in progress. 

I enjoy MTG and find Arena fun but do not love the deck editor and as such wanted to make a tool that could store hundreds of decks and had a better deck editor. Its just me on this project so it is moving slowly. Current work in progress (6/30/2022 10 PM EST)...
