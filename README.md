# Magic The Gathering Arena Deck Master
An application that can assist in managing decks for Magic The Gathering Arena and help build them.

A work in progress. 

I enjoy MTG and find Arena fun but do not love the deck editor and as such wanted to make a tool that could store hundreds of decks and had a better deck editor.

I have included the initial beta release and believe I am passed alpha. Seems pretty bug free at this point with a complete feature set. As of 9/15/2022 I added the beta version to the setup folder along with the .NET installers needed to run the application. No application installer itself just unzip and run from directory after .NET is installed.
